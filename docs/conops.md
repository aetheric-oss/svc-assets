# Concept of Operations - `svc-assets`

Note on delegation: only allows for one level delegation. Only allows for asset
group delegations. If user wants to delegate a single asset, a group
must be created for this asset.

## :raised_hands: Motivation

Managing assets for operators can be a complex and challenging task.
Traditional methods of asset management are often cumbersome and
inefficient, making it difficult for operators to keep track of their
assets and collaborate with other operators to maximize their assets'
earnings potential.

The `svc-assets` micro-service was developed to address this problem. It provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of registering, updating, and grouping assets. Additionally, it enables operators to delegate grouped assets to other operators, improving collaboration and efficiency.

One of the key features of the `svc-assets` micro-service is its seamless integration into Arrow's platform software. This integration provides a uniform and smooth experience for operators and allows them to easily manage their assets within the platform, reducing the complexity of managing assets across multiple systems.

Furthermore, the `svc-assets` micro-service also helps Arrow's backend services to effectively dispatch and schedule flights by providing real-time visibility into asset availability, this allows operators to quickly identify and allocate available assets to flights, improving scheduling efficiency and reducing delays.

In summary, the `svc-assets` micro-service addresses the challenges of managing assets for operators by providing a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process, improves collaboration and enhances operational efficiency.

## Needs, Goals and Objectives of Envisioned System
The needs, goals and objectives of the envisioned system revolve around addressing the challenges of managing assets for operators, simplifying the process and enhancing operational efficiency.

`svc-assets` addresses the need for a comprehensive solution that allows
operators to easily register, update and group their assets, as well as
delegate grouped assets to other operators. It aims to streamline the
asset management process and improve the efficiency of Arrow's
flight scheduling service by
providing real-time visibility into asset availability, enabling
Arrow's backend services to quickly identify and allocate available assets to flights.

Additionally, the system is designed to seamlessly integrate into Arrow's platform software, providing a unified experience for operators, and improve the backend services' efficiency.

The objectives of the system are to:

- Offer a comprehensive solution for asset management
- Facilitate the delegation of grouped assets between operators
- Integrate into Arrow's platform software
- Provide real-time visibility into asset availability
- Simplify the process of managing assets for operators and improve the
  efficiency of the flight scheduling capability

Overall, the envisioned system is aimed to address the current challenges of managing assets for operators by providing an integrated, easy-to-use solution that streamlines the process and enhances operational efficiency.
## Overview of System and Key Elements

## External Interfaces
See the ICD for this microservice.

## Proposed Capabilities
The `svc-assets` micro-service will offer a range of features to operators, which are designed to simplify the process of managing assets and enhance operational efficiency. These capabilities include:

- **Asset registration**: The service will allow operators to easily register new assets and update existing asset information.

- **Asset grouping**: The service will enable operators to group assets together, making it easier to manage and delegate them.

- **Asset delegation**: The service will allow operators to delegate grouped assets to other operators, improving collaboration and efficiency.

- **Real-time asset visibility**: The service will provide real-time
  visibility into asset availability, allowing operators to quickly
  identify and allocate available assets to flights.

- **Integration with Arrow's platform software**: The service will
  interact with other Arrow's micro-services through gPRC interfaces to
  provide a uniform and smooth experience for operators and to enable
  efficient and accurate flight scheduling.

- **REST API Interface**: The service will be accessible through a REST
  API interface, making it easy to integrate into existing systems.

 - **Reporting and Analytics**: The service will provide reporting and analytics capabilities for operators to have a better understanding of assets usage and performance

Overall, the proposed capabilities of the `svc-assets` micro-service are aimed at simplifying the process of managing assets for operators and enhancing operational efficiency.

## Modes of Operation
The `svc-assets` micro-service will have two modes of operation:

1. **Interactive mode**: This mode will allow operators to interact with the service through a user interface. Operators will be able to register new assets, update existing asset information, group assets together, and delegate grouped assets to other operators. They will also be able to view real-time asset availability and schedule flights accordingly.

2. **Autonomous mode**: This mode will allow the service to operate independently, with little or no human intervention. This mode is useful for scenarios where the service needs to continuously monitor the availability of assets and schedule flights automatically.

Both modes of operation will be accessible through REST APIs, which makes the service easy to integrate into existing systems.

In summary, the `svc-assets` micro-service will offer two modes of operation, interactive mode and autonomous mode, that enables operators to interact with the service through a user interface and operate independently, with real-time asset availability monitoring and scheduling flights accordingly. Additionally, both modes are accessible through REST APIs which allows easy integration with existing systems.
## Operational Scenarios, Use Cases and/or Design Reference Missions
The `svc-assets` micro-service is designed to support a wide range of operational scenarios and use cases for operators of VTOL aircraft, vertiports, and vertipads, including:

- **Asset registration**: United VTOL, a VTOL operator, can use the service to register new VTOL aircraft into their fleet, providing detailed information such as make, model, and serial number, as well as attaching maintenance records, ensuring all the assets are tracked and maintained properly.

- **Asset management**: Air Cargo Ops, a VTOL operator, can use the service to track and manage their fleet of VTOL aircraft, allowing them to view real-time asset availability and schedule maintenance and repairs accordingly.

- **Asset delegation**: VertiPort Co, a company that manages a network
  of vertiports, can use the service to delegate grouped assets such as
  vertipads to different operators and set permissions for these
  operators to access and manage them, improving collaboration and
  efficiency.

- **Real-time asset tracking**: Sky Taxi Inc, a VTOL taxi company, can use the service to track their fleet of VTOL aircraft in real-time, allowing them to optimize routes and improve flight times.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: AeroNet, a VTOL network operator, can use the service to track the usage and performance of their VTOL aircraft, identifying opportunities for maintenance, repairs and fleet optimization.

In summary, the `svc-assets` micro-service is designed to support a wide range of operational scenarios and use cases for operators of VTOL aircraft, vertiports, and vertipads, providing flexibility to different types of companies to manage their assets in a way that works best for their specific needs.
